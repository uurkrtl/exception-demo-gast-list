## Bonus

Great, you're making good progress! Feel free to work on this voluntary bonus task as well. What is it about? The client would like to have a guest list that includes the names of all guests.

To prevent the list from getting lost, it should be saved in a text file and also read from it. This task will be presented to you in the form of test cases. First, write the test, then the implementation. Only proceed to the next test when all previous tests are passing.

-   Test 1: Write a test  `shouldBeEmptyInitially`  that

1.  creates an instance of the  `GuestList`  class
2.  calls the  `setGuests`  method with an empty list
3.  then calls  `getGuests`  (the result should be a list of strings)
4.  and checks that the result is an empty list

-   Test 2: Write a test  `shouldReadSameGuestsAsWrittenBefore`  that

1.  creates an instance of the  `GuestList`  class
2.  calls the  `setGuests`  method with "Karl" and "Ute"
3.  then calls  `getGuests`  (the result should be a list of strings)
4.  and checks that the result contains "Karl" and "Ute"

-   Test 3: Write a test  `shouldWriteToFileSystem`  that

1.  creates an instance of the  `GuestList`  class
2.  calls the  `setGuests`  method with "Theodor" and "Anette"
3.  and checks that the file  `guests.txt`  has been created and contains the lines "Theodor" and "Anette" Hint: Define the file path with  `Path.of("guests.txt")`  Hint: Read and write using the  `java.nio.file.Files`  class

-   Test 4: Write a test  `shouldReadFromFileSystem`  that

1.  writes "Stephan" and "Max" (as lines) to the file  `guests.txt`
2.  creates an instance of the  `GuestList`  class
3.  then calls  `getGuests`
4.  and checks that "Stephan" and "Max" have been read Hint: Define the file path with  `Path.of("guests.txt")`  Hint: Read and write using the  `java.nio.file.Files`  class

-   Test 5: Write a test that checks if an exception occurs when reading the file that does not exist

-   Test 6: Add an  `addGuest`  method that takes a string  `guest`  as a parameter and writes it as an additional line to the file.
